# Ruboost

This repository contains a simple static site for Ruboost.gg.

How to publish with GitHub Pages

1. Make sure `index.html` is at the repository root (already added).
2. On GitHub, go to: Settings → Pages (or Settings → Code and automation → Pages).
3. Under Source, select the `main` branch and folder `/` (root), then Save.
4. The project site will be available at:

   `https://RukkiLs.github.io/ruboost/`

Notes
- If you want the site to be a user site at `https://RukkiLs.github.io/`, rename the repository to `RukkiLs.github.io`.
- If you use absolute paths starting with `/`, convert them to relative paths or set a `<base href="/ruboost/">` in `index.html`.

Contact
- If you want additional changes (favicon, custom domain, CSS files), tell me and I will add them.
